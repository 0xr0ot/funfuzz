Just run:
./loopdomfuzz.py objdir

It will:
* Figure out which version of Firefox you are testing and use appropriate ignore lists.
* Create temporary Firefox profiles.
* Keep fuzzing new instances of Firefox until it finds a new bug.
* If it finds a bug, it will place a file in a wtmp*/ directory, and try to reduce it with Lithium.

objdir must be a Firefox object directory built with --enable-tests.
It's probably best if it has --enable-breakpad and you have minidump_stackwalk installed, but the breakpad integration isn't fully working yet.

To reproduce a bug with the extension in place (usually not needed):
./rundomfuzz.py objdir url
