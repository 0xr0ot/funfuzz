=== One-time setup ===

Grep all the files for "jruderman" and fix the paths ;)

Install the "DOM Fuzzer" extension, not as an XPI, but using a text file pointing to the directory containing the extension:
  cd fuzzing/dom/extension/
  pwd > [profile directory]/extensions/domfuzz@squarefree.com


=== Before starting ===

Clear out the w* log files from any previous run.

Set Mac OS X Crash Reporter to "Server" mode to suppress crash dialogs.

Turn sound off (mute the computer) if you intend to sleep.

Open firefox-bin.crash.log in Console.app and click Clear.

Make sure the last build that ran was the same one you're about to test, to avoid EM-restart issues.  (And make sure Firefox is closed.)


=== Run it ===

export MallocScribble=1
export MallocPreScribble=1

export XPCOM_DEBUG_BREAK=stack
export XPCOM_MEM_LEAK_LOG=1

python -u ./af_timed_run.py 120 urls-random "/Users/jruderman/central/mozilla/debug-obj/dist/MinefieldDebug.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin" | tee wlog


Can be left unattended overnight, for example.


=== After running for a while ===

For crashes, look through firefox-bin.crash.log using Console.app.




python -u ./wholeaked.py 120 "/Users/jruderman/trunk/mozilla/debug-obj/dist/MinefieldDebug.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin" | tee loggage.log
